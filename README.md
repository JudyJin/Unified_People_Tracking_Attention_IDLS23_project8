# Unified_People_Tracking_Attention_IDLS23_project8

This repository consists of individual Github repositories mentioned in the files.
The object detection is done on Roboflow and inference is made on the BoTSoRT repository.

The outputs from BoTSoRT is passed onto the attention module for gaze detection.
 
## Abstract
This project presents a novel framework that utilizes one-shot object detection models to analyze classroom settings and quantify attendance, safety, and engagement of the attendees. The proposed approach has the potential to revolutionize traditional classroom attendance tracking and provide a more comprehensive assessment of classroom dynamics, thereby enabling educators to tailor their teaching methodologies to improve student learning outcomes. The framework combines deep learning and computer vision techniques to provide a scalable and accurate solution for educational purposes.

## Improvements made
